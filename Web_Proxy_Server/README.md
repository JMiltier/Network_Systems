# üåê Web Proxy Server
A web proxy server capable of handling HTTP requests from clients to the HTTP servers. Typically the client would connect directly with the server, but useful to sometimes create/introduce an intermediate proxy. This proxy exists between the HTTP clients and HTTP servers, where the clients send HTTP requests to the proxy. Once receiving the request, the proxy forwards the request to the HTTP server. Then, the HTTP server sends a reponse back to the proxy, which in turn forwards that response to the HTTP client. This is advantageous for several reasons: performance, content filtering/transformation, and privacy. 

Proxy advantages outlined:
  **Performance**: Allows caching of frequently visited pages to reduce the extra time needed for creating a new connection to the HTTP server every time.
  **Conent Filtering and Transformation**: Inspect URLs from the HTTP client to determine to block some URL connections. The other benefit is reforming webpages for clients with limited processing capabilities. In this case, an example would be something like image transcoding.
  **Privacy**: If the HTTP server tries to log information about the HTTP client, it can only get information about the proxy (not the actual client). Imagine the benefits of when there are multiple proxies involved in a route. Makes it incredibly hard to trace the orginator.

### Program


## ‚öôÔ∏è SETUP
#### Web server testing
  - Launch the HTTP server within a commonly used web browser (i.e. Chome, Firefox) and direct requests to the server, port number, and `index.html` file. Example: [http://localhost:3000/index.html](http://localhost:3000/index.html).

## üìü USE
#### HTTP User (client) Commands
The request consists of three parts (separated by spaces):
1. method (GET, POST, HEAD)
2. URL (directory)
3. HTTP version
Example: `GET /Protocols/rfc1945/rfc1945 HTTP/1.1`

### Compiling
  Note: If zipped, first unzip file before proceeding. `tar -zxvf <zipfile>`
  1. From root directory, run `make echoserver` from the terminal. This will generate a program called *echoserver* that is a simple server that responds back 'Hello World' in an h1 tag.
  2. To create the webserver, run `make` or `make webserver` to create a webserver executable object. Follow steps in next section for execution.
  3. `Make clean` will remove all files generated by `make`.

### Executing
  Once webserver objet is created, run `./webserver <PORT>` in the terminal/console from the root directory of the executable file. Next, go to a web-browser and go to `localhost:<PORT>`. This will direct to the default index.html page, where links can be requested and transferred from the server.
